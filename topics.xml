        Rovival of Rollor Skating
Forty or fifty roller skating
rinks have been built and opened
to the public in New England
New Jersey and other states with 1
in the year All are well patron
ized and their promoters believe
that this sport neglected for 20
years will again become popular
In the late 70s and early 80s roll
er skating almost attained the dig
nity of a national amusement No
person was too oldior too young
to use the rinks The hockey
games endurance races and exhi
bitions of fancy skating arranged
bv rink owners attracted big aud
iences for four or five years be
fore the popular appetite was sat
isfied Then and almost in a moment
roller skating fell into disfavor
Only children clung to it and on
them it has never lost its hold
This sudden loss of popularity
was due simply to the fact that
the pastime was worked to death
for although a good many harsh
charges were made by solemn
moralists against it these never
could have killed it Now it is re
turning as a novelty with another
gene ration of pleasurcscekers to
appeal to but it is improbable
that it will ever regain the glory
it once had The outofdoors
cult has made great progress since
1885 and roller skating is an in
door game</text>

        <text>A Roller Skating Rink
Will Open March
Third,
It has been a long time coming,
many have thought, but it has arrived.
At least the preliminaries havo been
arranged for inaugurating tho "roller
skating craze" in Honolulu,
The Honolulu Skating Ilink Com
pany hag been organized bv a number
of young men. of whom Clifford Kim
ball is the business representative. A
skating boom has been in tho air for
somo timo and this ontcrpriso is its
culmination,
Having taken the Union Feed Co.'s
old warehouse at (jucen and Edinburgh
streets for u rink, tho company
will open it to the public on Saturday
evening, March 3. Lumber is already
on tho ground for tho skating floor. A
supply of skates is on tho wny. They
are or steel with ball bearings in fact
the type of skate in uso on the Coast
and in the roller skating rinks of New
York and Boston. On tho inauka siilo
of the building tho walls are to be
opened up for admitting the cool
breezes. This will make for comfort
in tho exhilarating sport. A lean-to on
tho Waikiki sido will bo fitted up. as a
ftr.injlaf nnrl. aiu uvMrtfofn.. fliAvn a
"Slsofjto be' a jiodnwator booth on the
premises, but ,no spirituous, malt or a
vinous liquor will bo sold. Arc lights
will bo -installed, which will make the
rink always brilliant.
Of course an admission feo will be
charged, as well as a skating feo. The
riuk will be run on a first-class basis,
in ehnrgo of a competent man. It is
believed by the promoters that tho
time for starling bucu a place of amusement
is opportune. For a long period
there has been' a dearth of popular entertainment
other than theatricals and
field Bports.
To tho younger generation of Honolulu
folks up to twenty-five years of
age skating will ba an absolute novelty,
for it is twenty years since tho
previous voguo of that amusement
here. And thero Is undoubtedly a
larger population of tlnW hankering
after that class of diversion, combining"
exorcise with rollicking fun, In Honolulu
now than then.
The craze will bo a pastimo, moreover,
for ninny onlookers of tho large
class who take enjoyment from seeing
others making joyful. At suitable intervals
there will bo masked or fancy
dress carnivals held for tho jollification
of tho town. In the former craze
theso wero highly successful features,

Surely nothing else 'could set adult
human beings to going round and round
and round like this, singly and in pairs.
In a sort of speechless ocstacy.,
Round and round and round thslr
bodies swaying this way and that in a
strange rhythmic motion.
Round and round and round— sometimes
faltering, staggering, clutching frantically
at thin air. from fatigue or excess of emo
tion, no doubt.
Round and round and round— sometimes
suddenly falling with a crash or a thump
—according to the meagerness or ampli
tude of the structure of the beings—mo
mentarily overcome by exhaustion or
fervor perhaps; then struggling to their
feet again with wild gestures and frantic
efforts, unheeded by the speeding throng.
Devil-driven can they be, these madly
hurrying, swiftly gliding beings?
Round and round and round— urged ever
onward when their spirits seem to flag
and their limbs to las by the intoxicating
plinky-planky-plunk of the piano that
must be devil-played, even as the beings
are devil-firlven. for no visible fingers
press the keys that are uncannily lifting
up and dropping down, striking the notes
to which the hurrying throng; keep time.
Round and round and round— the young
and the old at»d those of middle life, never
speaking, never smiling, never laughing,
their eyes fixed In rapf gaze, perhaps
of adoration, or. celestial" contemplation
one or another now whirling and rushing
backward, as if taken with sudden vertigo
or touched with madness of despair or
joy. then whirling again and going for
ward as before, ever on and on and on.
As I sit at one side, alone, upon a chair,
among the tiers of empty chairs, alone
and unheeded by the speeding throng that
iaoks never to the right nor the left, but
ever Into some dim beyond. I note that
the" came beings flash past my vision
again and again, -on an endless, :#mle33
journey, some steadily like the planets
ir: their orbits, others spasmodically dash
ing In and out among the rest. In erratic
course like comets.
I note, too, that when indeed brtngs
that have become familiar drop out, new
beings appear and the throng hurries on.
ever on and on and on, without diminu
tion of members or of speed.
Round and round and round they go
youths and maidens clasping hands and
swaying in unison; youths and maidens
gliding singly and seemingly unconscious
of each other; youths and maidens pursu
ing each other, overtaking and capturing
each other without losing one single
rhythmic beat of the curious gliding mo
tion.
Roi:nd and round and round they go
the beings of middle life, male and fe
male, finely, with arms crossed behind
then or hands thrust deep into their
pockets, lost In meditation or the deli
rious joy of motion; fla pairs, supporting
each other In the onward struggle, mak
ing mighty effort and but small and tor
tuous progress.
Round and round and round they go—
even. the aged, the patriarchal males with
ba!d her ?s or white beards, the females
stout but determined, or those luckier'
ones whose gray locks and wrinkles must
be marked to belle the slendcrness of
their waists.
Round and round anG round they go—
and darting In and out among them, with
waving arms and legs and a port of stud
led malice in their movements, are these
imps .sent' to iotment them, to lmp«-de
prnjrress and endanger limb and life, to
afflict them and make their penance more
real, or are they, indeed, as an extraor^
dinary indulgence and toleration would
fee-em to indicate, mercy the young of
Ihtir kind the exub«rar»i. undisciplined
male young?
I note— irom my chair among the tiers
of empty chairs— that a. strange rumbling
accompanies the movement of these be
inc?. Even as I reared the great build
ing—can anything co hideous be a tem
ple?—l noted It and wondered.
Is it an undertone of groans and lamen

I look more closely.
Surely these are little wheels, little sets
of wheels s'-'ch as are used for moving
about th<; furniture indwellings, the. tittle
t\ heels called casters, that are :fasiened
to their feet, even as- they! are .to th*.

wheels, 1 note, that make .the strange
Tumbling sound, and send* the. beings on
their eliding., curving dashes with which

Wonderful! Wonderful!
What can thUs weird ceremony, this

Is ,It that these beings of all ages and
conditions— for, I note the great and lowly
mingling here, even clutching at each
other— are doomed to glide In an eternal

This I «ay, would have been the form

Why 'is roller skating?
Now that th\> question is popped at you,
you' can no more answer, it, I'm sure;
than -you, can answer that other profound
fjucry that Is' chiefly used to break .the
fbc-ial ice:
I Why Is an oyster?
Acd" what It is is as great a mystery as
why it is. \u25a0
Roller skating in surely not a sport.
This going round and round and round
on little wheels In "a circumscribed, In
clcscu area Is.no more .like ice skating,
with Us freedom, and possibilities-, and
surprises and tingling exhilaration,' than
that mild nursery concoction. called "canv"
brie tea is like the beverage that chee,rs.
It surely. is not an athletic exercise/ for
\u25a0 !t combines .the maximum of speed with

course, in .the initiatory stages, where the
reverse i« true.

of the Beginners' Pens of any one of
the rinks persevering side by side with
the hoi polloi. striking out as wildly
.•with arms and feet, going down a3
clumsily, all of a heap, grinning aa
sheepishly when struggling to the feet
that usually tread exclusive 'ways,
"Mixing" democratically, too. and not
a little selfishly, for one pretty bud go
ing to her Pacific Heights home in a
Larkin-street car artlessly confided to
a friend, and the rest of us:
"I've just had the loveliest time at
the rink. I skated most of the evening
with a riveter.* he called himself, front
the Iron works. He's a splendid skater
and his hands are as rough as as—
bark. Tehee r
"He said he'd look for me next time ha
came.. Just fancy! Tehee!"-;"
And it wasn't a snobbish tehe«»! at all,
let me tell you, 1 but just of girlish enjoy
ment, and we all teheed with her, at
least In sDirit.
What Is there in roller skating that
makes its victims willing to endure the
agonies of the Beginners' Pen?
One can understand the perseverance of
the boy in the' sweater who slides and
joggles and spraddles .and sprawls his
unruly way from one end of it to the
other, for in strenuoslty is joy for the
bor kind.
But the stouV and studious Individual,
professional by his spectacles and soft
white hand 3. sedentary by his rotundity—
what is there in this latest, maddest fad"
that sets him to struggling with those
fiendish little wheels that snatch his feet
from under him. that bump him. Into wall
and pillar and fence, that set him to wav
ing his -arms like a windmill gone mad.
that plump him flat upon the floor with
an impact that jars his teeth In their
sockets?
What Is there in it that inveigles the
matron out of her dignity into slipping
and; sliding about on costers, clutching at men and women
without the formality of an Introduction,
remember whom she would scorn to put
on her visiting list?
Whatever it is. it's a very potent charm,
for from its first dtvotees— the merely
young and giddy and unclassified— lt has
spreaJ until there is no safety in age or
rank. From their first neadquarters,/ at
the large and necessarily democratic Me
chanics' Pavilion, they have overflowed
until there's a rink in every quarter.
Society, of course, cannot be democratic
long, and having fallen victim to the fad,
it soon organized itself into a club that
ei: joyed the privileges of the Pavilion
without the intrusion of the mob one
nisrht every week. It was the Monday
Night Club, with a membership of 500. and
a list of patronesses that included the
names of the undisputed leaders— Mrs.
Kleanor Martin, for instance: Mr& Dow
ney Harvey, Mrs. Walter Hobart, Mre.
James Follia.. The club was organized
foi but four nights' skating, but so splen
didly did the finances and the enthusiasm
hold cut that its skating extended over
nine nights, and it has disbanded reluc
tantly oaly at the approach of Lent.
So potent is its charm that it has be
guiled not only the most unexpected
victims into skating, but hard-headed
business men into investing their
money in leases, rink floors and skates.
The pavilion is frankly democratic,
advertising its masked skating carni
vals unbiushlngly with prizes for "a fat
ladles* race," "most comic lady's cos
tume" and "most comic gent's costume."
So. quite naturally. In the face of this
there has sprung up a new and exclu
sive rink on Pacific avenue. In the old
armory, that was once upon a time in
its history a riding school for fashion
also. Here all sweaters and never
show-dirt shirts are to be barred; no
"fat ladles* races" are to be contested:
no "genta" are to be on the list of eli
gibles. It is to be small and highly
select, and already its list of patrons
reads like a chapter from the Blue
Book.
Jewish society has made for itself
quite the most exclusive \u25a0 and hand
somest skatlnfe rink in the city by turn
ing the spacious, lofty, well lighted,
beautifully floored ballroom of the
Concordia Club from its original pur
pose. There the 'club members practice
of mornings" with skilled instructors,
and there they have a ladies' night once
a week that is as well attended as tha
smartest dance or swcllest wedding.
Quite as naturally rinks sprang up or
are about to. spring up in the Mission,
in the Richmond district, south of
Market and— where do you think this
last one Is? on' the Barbary Coast!
Yes, even those freebooters of the night
life are abandoning the waltz and the
two-step -33 they practice it and are
taking to the little wheels and going
round and round and round with the
rest of the World, fashionable and
otherwise. CfcJK \u25a0
What greater proof can there be of
the lure of the roller skate when in this
territory, already famous for its skates,
the denizens take to the new kind!

Van Slcklen wearing apparel were dis

they would do the most good. The dilapi

protestations, he Insists that it was a.

        <text>COSTUMES FOR THE
ALL-ABSORBING CRAZE
Feminine Tears
Are Unbecoming
V I V-l ls considered unbecoming by w*nen to
a I shed tears when in trouble. They are
SBS B •_« placing themselves on an equality with
WOW O mei^ in all way«, and, hs men are sup
posed, never to be guilty of such weak
ness, women also must imitate this
stoicism and develop hardness or Htrong-minded-
QeM, whichever we may choose to call it. It is
very questionable if this is good for women in
any way; it is a relief to shed tears, and many a
nun would be glad if it were not regarded as
CowardiM for him to weep. It is Nature's meth
od, or one of her methods, of assuaging grief, and
the inability to indulge in tears leads many men
to drink as a means of giving vent to their feel
ings. .'._
From another point of view, however, this stoi
cism is certainly prejudicial;. that is, in the
chances of marriage. Whatever men may say, it
is inherent in them to like a tender woman; they
tte in her one who will sympathize with them,
and who will come to them for sympathy.' No
man really likes to see a woman cry, for it hurts
K irn and makes him uncomfortable until he can
do something to relieve ,but all men prefer
a woman who can and does cry. Not a foolish,
faint-hearted specimen of humanity, who flops
down at any trouble, however small, but really a
tender-hearted creature who, although brave'
enough, does not try to encase herself in a kind
of additional outer skin, or suit of mail, that will
render her proof against sentiment. A woman
of that sort, they not unnaturally imagine, will
be a very undesirable helpmeet in thia world of
ups and dowus, and they look for one who has
not lost the ability to weep in true feminine
iushiou.
In spite of their moral strength, Mien always
want some one in whom they can eonfld| What
encouragement can they expect fcoin a woman
who knows not how to wet-p, amP regards it as
undignified?
T— ""IHE athletic Winter Girl is bubbling over
with the buoyancy of her spirits.
mjgWfl What's the answer? Guess.
KSECq Another hygienic and beauty-wooing
diversion has been added to her list of
indoor winter sports, roller skating;
before which throngs of enthusiasts willingly bow.
And mcthiukn that morning tennis and croquet
clubs, which were so fashionable last winter, will
now go a-begging.
This whirling through the air is a most invigo
rating form of exercise, keeping the body in a
good, steady motion (that is, after you have gone
through the preliminary stages of proper balan
cing, when your physical and mental forces some
times woefully desert you).
The exercise brings all the muscles of the body
into play, stretching those the average woman
seldom employs, besides stimulating the blood
into healthy, vitalizing action.
Not one woman in ten takes the proper amount
of exercise; yet she wonders why she easily tire*,
why her complexion is dull and colorless and her
circulation poor and languid. Here's her beauty
balm, packed down and running over.
The benefits of ukating are materially increased
when the fair whirler will make up her mind to
take deep, full breaths, such a* can only be ac
complished when the shoulders are thrown back
and client out, in place of the atingy, little in
halations that utterly ignore the upper portions
of the lungs.
ROLLER SKATING ABROAD.
Heir, then, is au ideal exercise, that will keep
you in good physical trim until the outing season
intervenes. Let me conclude thin overture set
ting forth the manifold benefits of roller skating
by saying that Madame Heavyweight and her
oliiu, aimeinir little sister will i-.ich deiive physi
cal battarOMDt particularly suited to their indi
vidual woe».
We Americans are faddists at best with regard
to our pleasures.
T.OS ANGELES HERALD SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT
We take hold of a new diversion, run it to
death in six months, shelve it and take up an
other. With the present advent of roller skating,
however, it is likely that it will make good for
a considerably longer time.
In foreign capitals, London, Paris, Vienna and
Berlin, roller skating is regarded quite as essen
tial an amusement as theatres and music halls,
and here the rinks are never closed except in
midsummer.
The costuming is usually elaborate, often fanci>
ful, and the scene as a whole, a very picturesque
and interesting spectacle.
.mere is a wide difference between the charac
teristic types of the skaters of the two countries;
the sturdy, blonde-haired (Jerinun fruulein, and
the dninty Parisian, with her perfect coiffure and
chic toilette, are good example* of whut 1 mean.
Fancy dress costumes, bal masques, as Paris
calls them, are frequent occurrences, and many
of these are given, both in private rinks, rented
especially for the occasion, and in the large pub
lic rinks. All manner of fancy skating is intro
duced, and in some cases national dances are
given on roller skates.
In London, while the King, Queen Alexandra
and Princes* Victoria do not actually indulge in
the merry sport, they often occupy a private
box on gali occasions, and saem to thoroughly en
joy the merry spectacle.
Pauline Chase, the original Pink Pajama Uirl,
hat recently introduced a very novel skate dance
in Ixindon that is making a great hit.
But how boon, here in America, are we going
to introduce our foreign cousin*' idea of a carni
val on roller skates? Here's a chance for a wide
awake manager!
<;\KH ACCORDING TO HOUR OK lUY
The Americau girl, as ever, has adopted l>rue
i,,il and becoming attire for this indoor *p«rt
that i.i in perfect taste for the- hour of day or
uight.
For the morning sessions the fair skater is very
simply gowned in a rather severe tailored suit,
with morning skirt of plaited linen or dainty ba
liste, or fine French flannel, both styles being
frequently hand embroidered.
In place of the separate* waist, which is more
practical and comfortable on account of its light
weight, a waist is worn to match the skirt, mak
ing a three-piece suit. The waist may be of the
same material, or of silk trimmed with the cloth,
r more fashionable combination this winter. The
flannel waist referred to is not unpleasantly
heavy, as it is the same quality used for outing
wear in the summer.
White or cream serge skirt worn with lingerie
waist make* v pretty and attractive costume. The
skirt and waist, too, may be kept in the locker
or in care of the wardrobe woman and left there
for a small sum each week.
Roller skating seems to have captivated soci
ety people. Especially in the morning do the
girls make the largest showing, since there is
less to do on the social program, and a string of
automobile* and carriage* is always along the
curb at thia hour of the day.
GAY COSTUMES FOR AFTERNOON AND
EVENING.
Quite a stunning array of gown* is seen in the
afternoon, many of which are typical matinee
toilette*; short skirts, of course. A number of
dressy bodices are worn, white or those in pale
shades, harmonizing with the skirt*. A mlk or
ahiffon blouse will top off a skirt of plain cloth
or figured cloth. Many fetching plaid suits are
worn, and in place of the small turban hats,
larger one* are worn in the afternoon, laden with
flowers, grape* and feather*. The surplice and
fumpar with tfuimpes of lingerie, silk or
shiffon! Mry attractive.
Prime** and piiBMM corselet gowns aie worn
for afternoon and evening, developed in a quan
tity of fashionable materials.
At night the scene presented is brilliant; white,<
pale and brilliant colors are worn, and the gown
ing is often quite elaborate. A favorite style for
evening wear is a silk or velvet Dutch dress
(which is a princess, cut with low neck and
shoulder straps), worn over a frivolous little
guimpe of some sort, chiffon, lace or silk.
A striking model of this description was worn
the other evening; a wine-colored dress, panne
velvet, "with self-colored chiffon guimpe, trimmed
with bands of passementerie and silver buttons
and a large cream felt hat with wine-red plumes
shaded to pink.
Another was of black corduroy, princess corse
let (low) with bretelles of black velvet and baby
Irish crochet waist over pale blue chiffon. The
hat was a "magpie" model, narrow brim of cha
mois-colored felt and crush crown of pale blue vel
vet caught at the side with small black plumes
and rhinestone buckle.
I describe these costumes to show you how
the fittingly well-dressed women choose their rai
ment for hours of the day.
CONFIDENTIAL VIEWS ON THE SIDE.
Since Paris has taken up the no-corset notion, 1 1
see girls experimenting with the fad during the
morning, and undoubtedly the unrestrained exer
cise will do them much good, but the same girls
have small waist* in the evening. Feminine vani
ty is a stronger force than self-preservation.
Girl* who have long, narrow feet should choose
shoes with wide, extended soles, otherwise the
skates will not stay on, and when they slip off
the soles a very nasty fall is sure to follow. For
a 3tt-A shoe, a number 8 pair of skate* is re
Short »kift| should be worn, those that touch
or nearly 10, are too long aud are likely to throw
you. U y° u have a pair ot bloomers, us
this doe* aw »y wilh e*t«'a skirU, save the O i,g
which makes your effort in skating mv.li
easier aud you fuel several pounds lighter on your
feet. MAKJOKIi;:
Why One Actress

for escaping Hymen's bonds. "Simply
"■■■■■■a* because I never found a man I could

"Once I approached matrimony to the eitent
of ordering my troußseau, but an incursion into
the bower of matrimony was thwarted solely by
myself, because I realized I did not love the man

"An actress true to her art should not marry.
We women in dramatic art have all the virtues,
the same ideals, the tutiue love of home, of par

other stations of life. But we make our own
roads. Having completed them, as we baliavt,
we find often they are still rough, and we do not

them ready. Why, then, hamper us with matri

        <text>In the ten months of this year In
Greater -New York VK young lives were
sacrificed to the craze for roller skating.
Sometimes the trouble came at the
handa of automobiles or heavy trucks.
and sometimes the boys and girls, going
faster and faster on their down-nm-
coast, fell and that ended It all. For
they gain great speed as they get under
way, and when an accident comes the
blow is pretty heavy, and the little folk
pay the price of their venturesome plea'
sure.
Worth While to Take Care.
Probably those figures are not ap
proached in any other city in the world.
Europe cannot equal them anywhere,
and surely our smaller cities and towns
do not pay so oeariy tor tne cnuaisn
pastime. But it Is worth wnile for
fathers and mothers everywhere to take
care when their little folk Indulge their
fancy for the sport; and if they do not
bar out the level spots they can stand
guard over the graves
A day or so ago when three little tots
were seen speeding and coasting about
on skates that fairly skipped over the
giound. some passersby were heard to
remark that there would be some broken
heads or shattered bones before many
days went by If that racing kept up
much longer. The only reply was "Non
sense," and as no direful reports have
been heard presumably all has gone well
with the loung racers, but tnose ios
deaths In one great cit. Just from roller
skating, make one realize that "Non
sense" Is not all that should be said
Whatever else those figures may em
phasize, there Is the one great crying
need thrt they bring to light the need
of the children for playgrounds where
they can gather together and play to
their hearts' content. Just as nolslli or
as quietly as they like
Infnlr to Children.
Few, very few of our cities, are fair
to the children. They warn them that
they must not do this and they cannot
do that, they must not play ball for fear
of broken windows and they must not
play with roller skates for fear of
broken heads Rightly enough they are
scolded and threatened when they run
ill iruiiL vi ma iu nco j ti uvo vi, .uc
drivers and run the rlek of something
worse They are told the 're a nuisance
with their shouting, they run staid
pedestrians down with their blcicles,
they give them a shock with their skat
ing, and the street Is no place for their
I i.o. do not. In sufficient numbers, pro
vide big open spaces where there Is no-
tody to "call them down,' and do not
make up for half the "don'ts" that are
uttered. I
Even once in a while we are eon-j
fronted with some great demand that)
we are told is a public necesslti vo
must have this for the sake of the city's
fair name we need that to show that I
we are progressive, and there is some
thing else that Is a common comfort,
and of course that cannot go by the
board
The city wants them, the clt needs
them, and money Is appropriated and
space devoted to the Improvements that
will make the city grow
But the children They want more
playgrounds and the need them too.
for the sake of growing big and strong
and wholesome like the blossoms that
have light, air, and room a plent
The bigger and more crowded the citl.
the greater the need for playgrounds,
but It Is only In the great open country
that there Is no pla -problem at all It
was In a little village this summer that
a party of city folk saw scores of chil
dren playing about In the streets. That.
of Itself, was nothing, for they alwais
will play there But the strangers look
ed about them for the traditional "vil
lage green looked for front lards, back
yards, too. and they did not wonder that
the boys and girls flocked out to the
sfreets there was nowhere else to go
The rich folk, the well-to-do folk, the
comfortable even where, do not alwais
think very much about pla) grounds.
Their boys and girls can play In the
open, and can keep off the busy streets,
but of those 10b children killed while
roller skating, most of them skated and
played In the thick of traffic because they
had no play space of their own and no
big place where they could go.
Children do not have to skate, do not
have to romp and shout or play on the
city streets, but nature made them want
and need to, and cities should give them
the space.</text>

        <text>When I think about roller skating as a kid, I remember fun Friday nights at the skating rink with friends, pop music and treats at the snack bar. There was the joy of going fast, and the occasional wipe out from going a bit too fast.  Not a problem for 4-year-old Betty Buck, since the caption for this charming photo states she is “equipped with bumpers fore and aft” and has adopted the motto of “safety first” as she learns to skate. People of all ages have enjoyed roller skating for well over a century.  Take a roll down memory lane through the following images from the Prints and Photographs Division’s collections.</text>

WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.?Following in the text of President Wilsons
message vetoing tlic Volstead war-time prohibition enforcement measure:
"To the House of Representatives: j
"I am returning without my signa?
ture IL R. 6810, 'an Act to prohibit
i intoxicating beverages, and to regu
late tho manufacture, production, use
and sale of high-proof spirits for
other than beverage purposes, and
to insure an ample supply of alcohol
and promote its use in scientific re?
search and in the development of
fuel, dye and other lawful industries.'
"The subject-matter treated in this
I measure deals with two distinct
I phases of the prohibition legislation.
One part of the act under considera?
tion seeks to enforce war-time pro?
hibition. The other provides for
the enforcement which -vas made
necessary by the adoption of the con?
stitutional amendment. I object to
and cannot approve that part of this
legislation with reference to war

The United States has completed
the legislative process of voting itself

diction thereof for beverage purposes
is hereby prohibited.
"Sec. 2 The Congress and the sev
eral States shall have concurrent
power to enforce this article by ap
propriate legislation.
"Sec. 3 This article shall be in
operative unless it shall have been
ratified as an amendment to the Con
stitution by the legislatures of the
several states, as provided in the

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 Prohibi
tion became part of the basic law of
the United States today. Ratification
of the federal amendment by the Ne
braska legislature made that measure
the eighteent amendment to the fed
eral constitution.
All but a half dozen of the forty
eight states are expected to adopt the
amendment in the next few weeks, but
the action of Nebraska today gives the
ratification of thre-fourths of the
states, the number necessary to ad
minister John Barleycorn the k. o.
punch.
One year from today every saloon,
brewery, distillery and wine press in
the land must close its doors unless
as now seems likely, they are already
closed at that time by war prohibi
tion, which goes into effect next July
1, and stays until completion of de
mobilization. The amendment which outlaws li
quor in this country reads:
"Section 1. After one year from the
ratification of this article, the manu
facture, sale or transportation of In
toxicating liquor within, the importa
tion thereof into, or the exportation
thereof from the United States and all
territories subject to the jurisdiction
thereof for beverage purposes are
hereby prohibited.
"Section 2. The congress and sev
eral states have the concurrent power
to enforce this article by appropriate
legislation.
"Section 3. The article Rhall.be in
operative unless it shall have been rat
ified as an amendment to the consti
tution by the legislature of the sev
eral states as provided by the con
stitution within seven years of the
date of submission thereof to the states
by Congress.
This is the amendment adopted by
Congress December 18, 1917, and rati
fied by thirty-six states a little more
than a year later.
And these are some of the things
that the amendment will do:
Wipe out a stroke 236 distilleries;
992 breweries and over 300,000 saloons
and wholesale liquor establishments,
forcing thir employes to seek other
jobs.
Cut off from these persons annual
incomes totalling more than $70,000,
000 in pre-war times.
Cut off from the United States treas
ury a source of taxation counted upon
for an even billion dollars in their
first drafts in the new revenue bill
and millions in additional income to
state treasuries.
Remove the liquor question from na
tional, ate and city pontics for all
times and help increase city, state
and federal expense by decreasing law
violations.
The fight on liquor, triumphant to
day is as old as the constitution it
self. It raised its head early In the nine
teenth century and was looked upon
as "another crank notion."
But it gathered strength. Churches
took it up, doctors followed and then
came the organization of anti-liquor
societies, the anti-saloon league an1
others.
In the middle of the ninteenth cen
tury Maine went dry. Kansas fol
lowed. At the end of the Civil War
the little Wind of anfi-slave agitators,
who had won their fight, seriously
considered turning to the prohibition
battle. Their number included Wil
liam Lloyd Garrison and Poet Whit

"militant stage" in the person of Car-

most picturesque figure the fight ever

Ten years later the crusade against
liquor had grown from the "ravings
of cranks" Snto an irresistable move
ment that swept the country.
But John Barleycorn will try to
stage a "come back."
Distillers are already planning a
fight on the amendment in the courts
on the ground that it was not adopted
by two-thirds of the whole Congress
and that the seven years limitalon in
it invalidates the measure.
The drys say they are confident that
neither of these contentions will hold

internal revenue bureau will be asked.

Will Be tho First to Act On
New Prohibition Amend-
ment.
Leader of tho Drys Expected

Tobacco,
Itenuulicnn Administration Not
Living. Up to Efficiency
Promises.
BIO FIRES ARE NOW-FREQUENT
Week after next tho Kentucky
Legislature will convene and the
eyes of tho country will be turned
this way, as this toody will bo the
first to act on the new prohibition
law just passed in Washington.
Those familiar with the affairs of
this State realize that tho coming
Legislature is practically committed
fo a prohibition amendment, but Its
action will toe heralded broadcast by
the Prohibitionists that Kentucky is
anxious to go into the dry column
and is more than half way ready
to adopt the constitutional amend
ment as submitted by Congress
and tho Senate. All of tho
Kentucky leaders of Democracy
from Gov. Stanley down are
In favor of submitting tho
question of State-wide prohibition tp
the people, and regardless of the
action of our .national bodies it Is
hoped that the people of Kentucky
will be given an opportunity to
register their opposition to this
narrow-minded and fanatical meas
ure. One consoling thought to the
people of this State will be that this
legislation marks the passing of the
hypocrites and fakers who have
made Frankfort their headquarters'
at every legislative session. The
usual figure-heads of this clan are
the down-and-out country preach
ers who; not able to secure a
church or congregation, use prohibi
tion as their means of making a
livelihood. They are assisted by
tho narrow-minded fanatics who
are insane on the subject, and last
but not least the wily politician, who
uses the Anti-saloon Leaguers and
the Prohibitionists to further his
political ends.
Kentucky has been cursed with
prohibition politics for tho past sev
eral years and it will toe a relief to
have tho question settled by the
people. There has hardly been a
Democratic political convention or
primary that Haly and Beckham
have not held the bugaboq prohibi
tion up to control the party, and
good men have been driven from
active service because they could
not seo their way clear to ,hark
back to tho days of Salem wlth
craft and Puritan fanaticism. In
their places sprung up unknown,
obscure and Incompetent Demo
cratic leaders, under the guise of
Forward Leaguers, who presumed
to dictato to tho party as a whole.
The passage of the prohibition
amendment means, back to ob
scurity for them, unless they Join
the anti-tobacco reformers, who
hope to follow in tho footsteps of
the Prohibitionists. In tho Re
publican party stirring old leaders
like Senator Bradley and ex-Go v.
Willson have been succeeded by the
Republican Prohibitionists like Hert,
O'Rear, Bruner and Morrow, all of
whom are advocates of down with
the demons rum, beer and wine,
and probably unintentional advo
cates of the soft drink dope syrups.
Thus tooth political parties .'will be
in tho humor for a house cleaning
after the prohibition question is
settled.

the way of submitting to state legia
latures an amendment to th* Federal
Conatitutlon forbidding the manufect

United States or its terntones.
The vote in the House, taken after a

The margin for prohibition was juat

Bryan Congratulated
Both wets ar.d drys had been predict

until the last few names had been
called that the anti-prohibition forees
conccded their defeat. When Speaker

Washington, Aug. 1.? A six-year race
to make this a bone-dry country was
set going to-day, when the Senate by
a vote of ?i to 20 decided tt submit
a national prohibition amendment to
the states. This amendment must be
ratified by three-fourths of the states
within six years after it has been sub-:
mitted.
Tho six-year period w-,11 not begin
until the House of Representatives has
also passed by a two-thirds majority
the re.jolutior., but that this will be
done is not doubted by the most en
thusiastic wets. The highest hope of
the wets now to stave off the vote
:n the House until next session. The
House has until the expiration of the
present Congre??, on March I, l'Jl">, to
pass the amendment, so to nullify to
day's action in the Senate the wets
would have to stave off a vote in the
House until after that date.
Senators said 'o-night that this is the'
first time in the country's history that
a constitutional amendment. hns ever
had a time limit string to it. Thirty
six states. the necessary three-fourths
to ratify a constitutional amendment,
must have approved the bone-dry
amendment within six years following
the date the resolution is flnally passed
by both houses or it will fall to th"
grcund. If, six years after the House
nas passed the amendment adopted by
the Senate to-dav, only thirty-tive or
fewer states shali have approved it, all
the work done in getting the resolution
through I ongress and in getting those
thirty-nve legislatures to ratify it will
be lost.
Flght To Be Transferrcd
So the passage of the resolution bv
the House, which is eonceded to be
coraing, whethei this session or next,
will transfer the flght of the pro-
hibition forces to the state legi?-
iatures. The real battle will lie in a
tew states. It is probable, for in
stanre that but little atten'.ion will be
wasfd on such states as New York
and \'?w Jersey. The "drys" virtualiy
have twcnty-flve "sure" states states
which nrf now bone dry or nearly so,
Bt that they will only have to make an
upbill battle in eleven additional states
to ratify the amendment.
Ono or" the bijrgr?t surprises of the
day was not 'he vote on the final
adoption of the amendment, though
this was much larger than expected,
but the vote on r.n amendment by Sen?
ator Nevlar.ils. This would have made
the prohibition against -'distilled"
liquors, insiead of "intoxicating"
liquors, and would have saved light
wines and beer. It was defcated, 67 I
to 22.
Hy practically tha same vote tho
Senate refused to adopt a plan of Sen
Bttl P'nelan, of California, which would
have given the state legislatures the
right to pass either on a bone dry
amendn ent, or one prohibiting mereiy
diatilled liquors.
Senator Stone, of Missouri, one of
the prnnouncvl opponents of prohibi?
tion, trtatod the Scm.t" BBd fralleries
to another surpr.se. Waiting until the
clerk was reading the list of how the
Senators had voted. he \oted for the
r.m.endment. At once his col!eag-je,
Senator Reed. another pronouneed anti
prohibitioni-t, rushed to his desk.
After a hurried confab, he stood up
and addressed the Chair. He voted no.
This does not rcprcsent a conversion
on Mr. Stone's part, but mereiy his
idea 'hat the states should have the
right to determine the question.</text>

        <text>ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR W. R. STUBBS OF KANSAS, 
AT CHICAGO, SUNDAY, MARCH 27. 

In Which He Tells What Constitutional Prohibition Has Done for Kansas, 
Giving a Great Many Documents in Support of His Argument. 

I came to Chicago to defend the fair name of Kansas against the slanders of 
those whose interest it is to see our laws violated, our civilization defamed and 
our state policies impeached. 

I am going to furnish you and the country exact and indisputable facts 
concerning the enforcement and operation of the prohibition law in Kansas. 
The proof which I shall submit to you would be accepted as conclusive evidence 
before any court in the United States. 

I am anxious to know whether the good people of Chicago are willing to 
credit the statemn ;s of a combination of brewers and saloonkeepers who are 
spending hundred? of thousands of dollars annually to poison public opinion, 
and debauch t^e iaw in preference to the statements of those who are standing 
up for : 1, American home, working and pleading for decency in public life and 
making effo; ; in every direction to build up a great state on the foundation of a 
wholesome morality. 

I did not come here as a politician, for I have never yet had either the time 
or the inclination to iearn the laws or tricks of scientific politics. 

1 have never made a prohibition speech in my life. I am a practical, plain- 
speaking business man and while I regard the moral and sentimental sides of 
the question as constituting its strongest claim on society for support I propose, 
to a very large extent, to discuss the subject from a cold-blooded, economic 
standpoint. In other words, I am going to present it to you as a sound business 
proposition. 

When I was a candidate for governor in 1908 I made the campaign for my 
nomination and election on the proposition that if elected to this office every 
saloon, joint and place of every kind whatever regardless of the sentiment of 
the community had to be closed. This proposition was made in my campaign 
speeches to the saloon men in "wet" communities as well as to temperance 
people; I stated publicly all over Kansas — in Pittsburg in the mining districts 
as well as the localities where the law was enforced — that any man who estab- 
lished himself in the saloon business in violation of the laws and constitution 
of Kansas would be regarded the same as any other outlaw, and all the power 
and force of the state government would be used to punish and destroy his 
business. 

This does not mean that we have no violations of the prohibitory law, 
for if there were no violations such a law would not be necessary. It does 
mean that the prohibitory law in Kansas is as well enforced as other criminal 
statutes, and that when men violate it they are arrested, convicted and promptly 
sent to prison. 

The United States government has taken a step which will aid materially in 
stamping out the irresponsible bootlegger and whiskey vender who now is 
the principal violator of the prohibitory law in Kansas. Under direction of 
President Taft the Attorney General of the United States has ordered United 
States district attorneys in " 'dry' territory" not to compromise with men who 
violate the internal revenue laws by permitting them to pay fines, but to prose- 
cute them and send them to jail for a reasonable time. 

I want to especially impress the fact upon your mind that while Kansas had 
substantial prohibition for twenty-eight years it has had absolute prohibition 
only since May, 1909. Previous to this time liquor was allowed to be sold 
through licensed pharmacists, for medicinal, mechanical and scientific purposes. 
Abuse of this privilege led to dissatisfaction and the last legislature wiped out 
all exceptions and made the state absolutely "dry." Before they could sell 
intoxicating liquors these pharmacists had to obtain an internal revenue stamp 
and it is upon this circumstance in part that the agents and spokesmen of the 
breweries and the distilleries are trying to deceive you by showing the number 
of so-called licenses issued in Kansas last year. 

A further explanation of the number of licenses issued in Kansas is found 
in the method of handling violators of the Federal stamp law. When our state 
officers arrest a man' for selling liquor they notify the internal revenue officers, 
who come to him at once and collect a Federal license tax, often times finding 
the man in jail. This man is then quoted by the breweries, distilleries and sa- 
loon men of other- states as a saloonkeeper in Kansas, when in fact he is either 



in jail, paroled during good behavior, or under injunction never to again engage 
in liquor selling in our state. 

Under our state law the finding of a Federal license stamp in a place fitted 
up for the sale of intoxicating liquors is primae facie evidence of violation of 
the prohibitory law, and I challenge the brewers and distillers to show one in- 
ternal revenue liquor stamp posted in a saloon or joint in Kansas. 

While I am not an expert in the affairs of the local government of Chicago 
I venture the assertion that conditions which are due largely to the saloon and 
kindred evils of society constitute your most disturbing and distracting prob- 
lems. Usually cities having an ambition to solve such problems commission 
delegations of its wisest and best citizens to investigate the treatment of these 
problems by other communities. As chief executive of my state it would give 
me great pleasure to welcome delegations from Chicago to Kansas for the 
purpose of showing them the results of prohibition. We have had commis- 
sioners from Canada, New Zealand, England and Australia and even now the 
governments of Italy and Russia are investigating our methods of dealing with 
this evil, the greatest social and governmental problem on the face of the earth 
today. 

If wisdom should cause you to send such a delegation to Kansas I will 
guarantee they will not find a business man of standing in the state who will 
not testify that prohibition is the best business asset of Kansas. 

Prohibition must be judged by results — it must stand or fall upon its 
merits. The people of Kansas are very progressive, very positive and intensely 
practical in their ideas and habits. If the prohibitory law had not given us a 
better civilization and a higher type of manhood and womanhood it would have 
been repealed years ago. If it has increased drunkenness, crime and perjury, 
as saloon men claim it has done, the saloonkeepers would all be supporting the 
law instead of fighting it, for it would increase their revenue. 

This is .an age of conservation. Prohibiting the manufacture and sale of 
whiskey is more closely identified with a sound conservation policy than are the 
laws prohibiting the wanton destruction of the forests. </text>

THE LEGAL ASPECT OF PROHIBITION. 

JOHN CLEMENS BENTON. 

The prohibition movement grows apace. Indeed, it 
may be said, at last, to have attained the dignity of a 
national question. True, Congress has not as yet under- 
taken to legislate on the subject; and in fact, it has no 
power to do so (in so far as the general public is con- 
cerned) if the provisions of a seemingly obsolescent Con- 
stitution are of any force and effect whatever. True, 
also, that both of the great political parties continue to 
ignore the movement in their platforms. Nevertheless, 
ir many sections of the country it constitutes the most 
important local issue, and in all sections it is a more or 
less engrossing topic of political discussion. 

Already prohibitory liquor laws obtain in many 
States and communities, and, if we can credit current 
statistics, forty per cent, of the people of the United 
States chafe under their iniquitous and exasperating re- 
strictions. And, notwithstanding legal fictions to the con- 
trary, these laws do, in fact, deprive persons of property 
without due process of law; they do, in fact, impair the 
obligations of contracts, and they do, in fact, deprive the 
people of vested rights contrary to the letter and spirit 
of the Constitution. Moreover, they impede the growth 
and commerce of individual communities, thereby im- 
pairing the general prosperity of the Nation; they se- 
riously cripple the national revenue, and they tend to 
revolutionize the accepted theory of constitutional gov- 
ernment. 

For these reasons the question may be considered 
national, and, perhaps, the most important national ques- 
tion at present confronting the American people; the 
one of all others now pending most directly affecting the 
rights and- liberties of the people, and one upon the

The Pictures on This Page
Useful Fighting in the Senate, Horrible and Useless
Fighting Abroad.
For this page every Sunday we select pictures that
stimulate and illustrate thought. For instance, you see the
picture of war, fleeing in terror before the American flying
machines. This picture will be a reality, if those in charge
of American work can send ten thousand flying machines to
France in time.
The German soldiers will not sit in the trenches resigned
because the people at home are safe, once American flying
machines begin doing the work behind the trenches.
The allies have not been able to go THROUGH the Hin
denburg line. The United States will go ABOVE it with
enough flying machines sailing over the trenches, trench war
will end, and the whole war with it.
The humorous genius TAD, with whose work you are so
well acquainted, presents in his "Battle in the Senate" a
picture even more valuable than ridiculous.
It is a good thing for the United States that dis
tinguished Senators fight occasionally. Much truth comes
out in fighting. The grave statesmen are not physically as
active as Tad shows them. But Tad's picture of their com
bative bodies, represents fairly well their minds, when such
men as La Follette, who thinks that wealth should arry the
load, discusses taxation with the distinguished Mr. Simmons,
who thinks that too big a tax on wealth might "make the
war unpopular."</text>

It was decided to try to interview Orville

That is, they said they were flying?when con?
ditions were favorable.
That was the cue for Homeric laughter.
THERE ARE QUIETER MEN, BUT, AS
MARK TWAIN SAID. THEY ARE DEAD.
If any one should ask Orville Wright if he
enjoys being interviewed for publication he
would ' ? tell the truth about it, just as
he a- ther did in the early days about
their flights. Hut no one is likely to ask him
for the ti ilth?no one who has a job of inter
?, ?-.?. lo. It would be a poor interviewer
who ? eed verbal confirmation.
The v.: lei took out his pad and pencil once
in Dayton. And then he put them back again.
No one asked him to do this. Hope seemed
to poinl ' at way.
Asked for an expression of opinion as to the
lyed in the war by the flying machine,
Mr. Wright said:
"If i had had aeroplanes and the

WHEN .IKING ON AEROPLANES
OME'S AIM IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
Mr. Wright was asked what he thought of

an aeroplane is that of a regiment of infantry,

in estimating range. This theory has been ad?
vanced in a recent book.
"The time will come when they will learn
to shoot at aeroplanes," he replied. "During
the Ci**i1 War we would have thought it im?
possible e.er to shoot at something we could
not see. Now we have the range, and don't
need daylight."

sion is taken because of tho splendid
work of the army aviators In tho gov?

The War Department was kept, busy
early in February declining all sorts
of offers from aviators. It seems as if
every man in tins country who either
owns an aeroplane, or expects to do
so, during the past few days has of
fered to patrol the Mexican border for
the War Department. If the services
of every aviator who volunteered had
been accepted the heavens along the
Mexican border would soon be tilled
with ncroplatii! or the ground in that
vicinity strewn with the wrecks of
flying machines. Very wisely the War
Department decided to put this matter
entirely under the supervision of Lieu
tenant i.xF. Foulois, who Is at San
A 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 i i with the only aeroplane own
ed by the government. It is under
stood 'that the State Department, as
well as the War Department, feared
that a large force of civilian aviators
on the border might involve this gov
ernment in International complications
with Mexico.
Unless the aviators were under the
command of Lieutenant Foulois they
would bo very apt to fly ovit Into
.Mexico. There they might lie captur
ed n spies, and it would be very dif
ficult for tins government to extend to
them the protection which Is nsked by
every American citizen who gets into
trouble in a foreign land. It Is fear

ment that some of the amateur avia
tors may become so enthusiastic that
It. will be necessary to take steps to
restrain them.

        <text>aking into consideration the comparatively brief
time that has elapsed since the first heavier than air
machine flew, and the marvelous strides aviation has
made in that brief period, particularly within the last
twelve months, we feel sure that whatever obstacles may
remain in the way of the reduction of aviation to the
safe and practical will soon be overcome, and that aeroplanes
will be so perfected that aeroplaning will become
as safe as automobiling.
Need after need to secure automatic equilibration
and stability of the flying machine in its unstable path
is being discovered and met by men of the genius and
cool-headed daring of the Wrights, Curtiss, Harmon,
Hamilton, Paulhan, Farman, B16riot.
Two things are evident,?that mechanical flight will
be made safe and practical, and that the personnel of
the sterling qualities necessary for reduction to practical
utility is available.
What, then, are the prospective uses of aviation?
The paramount immediate use in times of peace is
sport; but soon, even in times of peace, commuters will
travel back and forth from suburban homes to large
centers of population by aeroplane. The time that can
be saved, and the sport coupled with business in such
travel, will recommend its wide adoption.
Cleared alighting areas or wide cleared avenues will
radiate from large cities in all directions, over which
aeroplanes may pass back and forth, with always a
place for safe landing underneath, should anything go
wrong.
Since man first swung a club in combat, warfare has
commandeered every invention it could utilize, and
often a little lead of one people or tribe over another in
some implement of war has meant victory for its possessor.
Therefore, we naturally inquire of Mars what
uses he holds in prospect for the flying machine.
We have recently had demonstrations of the ability
of the aeroplane to drop bombs on warships, coast fortifications,
and cities, and we have also had our sham
battles. A couple of aeroplanes from each of two French
army corps meet and fight a mock duel over Paris.

        <text>Oaring Aviator Fell 100 Feet When
Tailpiece Broke and Was Dashed to
Death In Presence of Big Crowd.
Hon. Charles Stewart Rolls, third
son of Lord Llangattock, and noted for
I his recent double flight across the
English channel, was killed at Bourne
mouth, England, at the aviation meet,
In which Armstrong Drexel so distin
guished himself several days ago.
The tragedy occurred in the pres
ence of n great company of specta
tors, a majority of whom were women
and children, and many of the per
sonal friends of the young aviator.
The Wright biplane on which he was
flying fell suddenly with terrific speed
from a height of 100 feet. It struck
the ground close to the crowded grand
I stand, smashed Into a tangled mass,
! and before the doctors and their as
! sistants could reach the spot Rolls was
dead.
The event in which Rolls was com
peting was for a prize for the aviator
alighting nearest a given mark. The
goal was directly in front of the grand
1 stand, where the spectators were
massed. He had risen to a good height
and then shut off his motor and was
gliding in a broad circle toward the
! mark.
Without warning the tail piece of
the biplane snapped off. The machine
gave a sudden lurch, and the frame
work crumpled up in the air. When It
struck the ground it was smashed to
splinters. The doctors found that
Rolls had sustained a fractured skull.
The wreck of the machine and twisted
stays surrounded the body so that
there was difficulty in extricating the
unfortunate man.
Lord and Lady Llangattock. the par
ents of Rolls, narrowly escaped wit
nessing the catastrophe. They were
yachting along the coast, and put In at
Poole, near Bournemouth, intending to
j attend the aviation meeting, but post
i poned going until after noon.
1 Audemars, the Swiss aviator, had a
; close shave while making a trial
flight. His monoplane overturned and
descended swiftly to the ground, but
he escaped without Injury.

        <text>Two flights of approimately one
hour each, and another flight in which
two men were whirled through the
air for upwards of si minutes -were
the achievements of the Wright bro­
thers aeroplane today. That these
flights, record breaking as they were,
%ill even be surpassed by Orvjlle
Wright during his,trials at Fort .Mteyer
Is confidently predicted.

Washington, D. C., Sep. 9.—Orvllle
Wright, in three phenomlnal flights
at Fort Mayer today, established a
new aeroplane record, that not only
assures the success of the official
trial before the army board, but in­
dicates that real flight is now only a~
matter of development
War on land and sea will find in
the aeroplane, it is now conceded by
military men, a valuable means of
reconnaisance and possibly carnage.
In the first flight the maclhne cir­
cled the drill grounds 57 times In 55
minutes and 31 seconds. This was
surpassed this evening when a flight
of 62 minutes and 15 seconds was
made.
Not satisfied with breaking all the
distance and time records for heavier
than air flying machines, Mr. Wright
took L/t. Frank P. Lahm, an aero­
naut of the signal corps, for a spin
around the drill grounds, and making
a new record for a two-man flight
All this happened so quickly and un
ostensiously that the spectators,
among whom were members of the
cabinet, high officers of the army
and navy, could hardly realize that
history had been made and that a
new era in the progress of the civi­
lized world was begun.
